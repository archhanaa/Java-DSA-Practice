# Arrays Practice (Day-2)

Today I practiced basic and intermediate array problems to improve my logic building skills in Java.

### ✅ Programs Completed
- Print array elements
- Reverse an array
- Find maximum element
- Find minimum element
- Count even and odd numbers
- Sum of all elements
- Linear search
- Count how many elements are greater than a given key
- Replace negative numbers with zero
- Average of array elements
- Count duplicate values
- Count unique values

These problems helped me understand loop traversal, comparison logic, and handling duplicates in arrays.

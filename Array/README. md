# Arrays in Java

An array is used to store multiple values of the same data type in one variable. 
Array indexing starts from 0 and ends at length-1.

Example:
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};

We can access values using index:
arr[0] → 10

We can loop through the array using a for loop and print elements.

Today I practiced:
• Printing elements
• Finding max/min
• Reverse array
• Second largest/smallest
• Counting even/odd
• Linear search
• Checking if sorted

Arrays feel clearer now and I'm becoming more confident with DSA basics.

# Recursion Programs (Java)

This folder contains simple Java programs that use recursion. These help in understanding how a problem can be solved by calling the same function repeatedly with a smaller input.

## Factorial.java
Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
Example: 5! = 120

## Fibonacci.java
Returns the nth number in the Fibonacci series using recursion.
Example: Input: 5 → Output: 5

## SumOfDigits.java
Finds the sum of all digits of a number by repeatedly taking the last digit and removing it.

## CountDigits.java
Counts how many digits are present in a number using recursion.
